# Claude Code Hooks Configuration Verification

## ✅ Configuration Status: WORKING CORRECTLY

### 1. Hooks Structure ✅
- Using correct array format with matcher and type
- Located in both `/home/admin1/.claude/settings.json` and `/home/admin1/.claude_code_settings.json`
- JSON is valid and properly formatted

### 2. Event Types ✅
Configured events (all valid per documentation):
- PreToolUse
- PostToolUse
- Stop
- SubagentStop  
- Notification

### 3. Hook Handler ✅
- Path: `/mnt/c/ChromeExtensions/Claude             hooks/claude-notifier/hooks/hook_handler.py`
- Correctly reads JSON from stdin
- Processes all event types properly
- Returns exit code 0 (success)
- Logs events to `events.log`

### 4. Data Format ✅
Hook handler correctly receives and processes:
```json
{
  "session_id": "string",
  "transcript_path": "path",
  "cwd": "directory",
  "hook_event_name": "EventType",
  "tool_name": "ToolName",
  "tool_input": {},
  "tool_response": {} // PostToolUse only
}
```

### 5. Integration Test Results ✅
- All test scenarios pass
- Hook handler executes without errors
- Events are being logged correctly

### 6. Live Usage Verification ✅
Recent log entries show hooks are actively triggered by Claude Code:
- PreToolUse events fire before tool execution
- PostToolUse events fire after tool completion
- Stop events fire when Claude finishes responding

### Platform Considerations
- Using WSL paths (`/mnt/c/...`) correctly
- Using `python3` command (not `python`) as required in WSL
- Directory name with spaces ("Claude             hooks") is handled correctly

## Conclusion
The hooks are configured and working correctly. The "invalid settings files" error should no longer appear. The only non-critical issue is the tray app connection, which is a separate component.
